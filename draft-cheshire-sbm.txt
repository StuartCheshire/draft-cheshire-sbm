Abstract

   In the past decade there has been growing awareness about the harmful
   effects of bufferbloat in the network, and there has been good work
   on developments like L4S to address that problem.  However,
   bufferbloat on the sender itself remains a significant additional
   problem, which has not received similar attention.  This document
   offers techniques and guidance for host networking software to avoid
   unnecessary delays for network traffic caused by excessive buffering
   at the sender, which are broadly applicable across all datagram and
   transport protocols (UDP, TCP, QUIC, etc.) on all operating systems.
